## Who Am I

I've been into open source development since 2010, ever since I had to pay someone to fix what I broke. On that day I decided to learn how to fix it myself: I've been learning ever since.

Through most of what I do can count more as a hobby, I would like to think that I'm pretty damn good even though I've blown up a few Linux/Windows installs in my time and lost a few GB of data.

## Things I'm Currently Learning

I'm learning more about btrfs filesystem and the benefits of a COW (Copy On Write) filesystem over the traditional EXT4 filesystem. The main reason for this is Ubuntu has decided to not fully support btrfs and I aim to work around that limitation.

## Things I'm Working On

The main project I'm working on is my static website hosted on Cloudflare Pages. I'm using the Hugo static site generator to generate the HTML and CSS for the site and my own custom theme.

- [Website](https://blackstewie.com) - My personal website about tech and other things.
- [Theme](https://github.com/MichaelSchaecher/simple-dark) - A simple dark theme for Hugo.
- [WSL](https://github.com/MichaelSchaecher/wsl-kernel-patch) - A patch to compile the Linux kernel for WSL2.
- [skel](https://github.com/MichaelSchaecher/skel) - My personal skeleton files.
- [init](https://github.com/MichaelSchaecher/systemd-scripts) - My personal systemd scripts.
