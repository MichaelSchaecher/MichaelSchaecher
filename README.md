## Who am I (root)

I've been into open source development since 2010, ever since I had to pay someone to fix what I broke. On that day I decided to learn how to fix it myself: I've been learning ever since.

Through most of what I do can count more as a hobby, I would like to think that I'm pretty damn good at what I do. I've after I've blown up a Linux install own or twice ðŸ˜…; but never more then that. That's how I know I'm good at what I do. No, really I do question my self a lot and about rather I know what I'm doing. Dispite that I still do it, still learn and still break things from time to time.

## Things I'm currently learning

At some point I what like to learn rust, but for now I'm learning manager a static site with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and I can say that I've learned more in the last 2 months then I have in the last 2 years with Jekyll. That comes down to the wide range of support that **Hugo** has and the documentation is pretty good too.

Besides the whole website thing, I'm also learning how to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for managing my home network. I've been using it for a while now for things like [Pi-hole](https://hub.docker.com/r/pihole/pihole), [Unbound](https://hub.docker.com/r/mvance/unbound) and [VaultWarden](https://hub.docker.com/r/vaultwarden/server). I did **Plex** for a time, but it stopped playing nice with my X-Box Series S as in stopped playing videos locally streamed, so I switched to [Emby](https://hub.docker.com/r/emby/embyserver) and it works great. And yes I did try **Jellyfin**, but having no support for remote control or game controllers is a deal breaker for me: so pleas **Jellyfin** add support for remote control and game controllers I really want to use your software.

## Things I'm Working On

Well other then the [website](https://blackstewie.com), I'm working on a few things:

### [btrfs-manager](https://www.github.com/MichaelSchaecher/btrfs-manager)

The Idea came about mostly because I wanted to see if I can create an application written in [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) that can manager [btrfs](https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page) file systems in place of [Timeshift](https://github.com/linuxmint/timeshift) which lakes the ability to manager btrfs subvolumes outside what [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) sets up for you. And [snapper](https://github.com/openSUSE/snapper) the configuration is a bit of a pain and unnecessary in my opinion. So I set out to create a simple application that can manager btrfs subvolumes and snapshots with dpkg/apt hooks.

### The WSL 2 Custom Kernel

A while ago I do so work on a custom Linux [Kernel](https://www.kernel.org/) for the **Windows Subsystem for Linux**, but do to some requirements for spyware needing to be installed developed by people that just used A.I. to write it for them and not testing it. Compiling it would cause my system to thermal throttle and/or crash. I do have a patch that would allow anyone to compile the kernel for the use with WSL 2. [patch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MichaelSchaecher/MichaelSchaecher/main/patchs/wsl-support.patch).
