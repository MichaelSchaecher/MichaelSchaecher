## About Me

I have been a tech enthusiast ever since I broke my first computer almost 20 years-ago (god I'm almost old enough to be a neck beard). After paying someone to fix it I decided to learn how to fix it myself. I have been learning ever since. I have a passion for learning new things and solving problems.

I current work full time at a pastic injection molding company make part for homes and firearms.

To me programming is a way to solve problems and make life easier and one the most enjoyable things I do to relax. That and play video games, but I am not very good at that.

## Skills

I am currently working on learning the following skills: Web Development using Hugo, DevOps using Docker and Kubernetes (though Kubernetes is a bit of a beast).

## Projects

I have a few repos that I am working on. I am currently working on a Hugo theme for my website that is based on [hugo-coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder).

- [website](https://github.com/MichaelSchaecher/website) - My personal website repo.
- [pihole-services](https://github.com/MichaelSchaecher/pihole-services) - Keeps Pi-hole updated and running on a Raspberry Pi.
- [pihole-n-unbound](https://github.com/MichaelSchaecher/pihole-n-unbound) - A docker-compose file to run Pi-hole and Unbound.

### WSL2

- [wsl2-kernel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MichaelSchaecher/MichaelSchaecher/main/patchs/wsl-support.patch) - A patch allowing the Linux Kernel to be compiled for WSL2.
